A CNN-based model to classify gender from facial images. Trains on a dataset of male and female images, applies data augmentation, and provides train/test accuracy along with loss and accuracy visualization.

## Features
- CNN architecture with Dropout & Batch Normalization
- Visualizations for training progress
- Prediction on new images

## Dataset
Organized in `train` and `test` folders with subfolders `male` and `female`.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Gender_Classification.ipynb`.
3. Train the model and evaluate results.
